                My name is Randy, and welcome to my website! I go by <strong>he/him</strong> pronouns and I am a third year Computer Science major at the University of California, Santa Cruz. My goal is to be in the software industry as a developer. I hope to gain experience to share to other future developers as I strive to teach at an institution.
